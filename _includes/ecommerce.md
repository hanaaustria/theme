                                As a buyer, it's worth noting that the quality of a product may vary among shops.

There is no sure way of knowing if the product is good outside of ratings and reviews from other e-commerce users.

                                Business platforms could be hacked, which is the harsh reality of online commerce. Customers want assurance that their financial information won't be shared or compromised when they make an online purchase and want to feel secure doing so. Businesses and organizations are targets of malicious hackers who take customer information from their databases. Not only does this undermine the trust in the company, but it may also have financial and legal repercussions.

                                Online retailers may need to abide by local laws in their own nations or states as well as the residences of their customers when selling to customers in other countries. This might be making accounting, taxation, and compliance very complicated.
